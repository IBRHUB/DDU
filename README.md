# NVIDIA GPU Drivers and Optimization

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive set of scripts and tools designed to optimize NVIDIA graphics drivers for Windows. It includes detailed instructions for downloading, uninstalling, installing drivers, and configuring settings to achieve peak performance.

## Installation Instructions
To learn how to download and install the necessary files, please watch this instructional video: [YouTube Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/bQh3s6xcjDM).

## NVIDIA Drivers
We sourced the latest NVIDIA graphics drivers from the [official NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).

## Driver Uninstallation
For a thorough removal of existing drivers, we use [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download/). This utility ensures a clean slate before installing new drivers.

## NVCleanstall
To streamline the driver installation process and reduce unnecessary components, we utilize [NVCleanstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall/). This tool helps in minimizing bloat and enhancing performance.

## NVIDIA Profile Inspector
To fine-tune the NVIDIA Control Panel settings, we employ [NVIDIA Profile Inspector](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector). This tool provides precise control over graphics settings to optimize performance.
